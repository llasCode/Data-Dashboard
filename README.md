# Spotify Data Dashboard

-This dashboard is a web application made with the Highcharts JavaScript library and PHP for the connection with the database (MySQL). <br /> It shows data from the most streamed songs of 2023. The data has been collected from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data). <br /> It is noteworthy to mention that all the charts have an accessibility description for screen readers.

# Instalation

-Clone this repository in the xampp/htdocs directory. <br />
-Set the local web server and import the SQL code. <br />
-Now you can visualize the webpage at http://localhost/P1_ADIIU/. <br />

# Code

-In the folder backend, you can find the sql database code, the php files to make the connection to the database and to get the data from it with Select queries. <br />
-In the css folder, there are some basic styles for the html. <br />
-In the js folder, the buttonChart file has the logic to show a chart when a button is pressed in the web. <br />
-The other files, index, controller, and charts, are responsible for retrieving the data from the database, encoding it into a JSON format and passing it by parameter to create the charts with the HighCharts library.
